### Geography

Originally from Torino, Italy, I'm currently living in the sunny Lisbon, Portugal. 

### Food

As a classic cliche' about Italian, I love eating Italian classic pasta and pizza. 
However, I'm a big fun of the following cousines:
* Mexican
* Japanese (not only sushi)

### Readings

I am very curious and I like to read a bit about everything. Here below the last 
books I read:
1. In cold blood by Truman Capote
2. About a boy by Nick Hornby
3. The dogs of winter by Kem Nunn
